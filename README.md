# AWS Static WebSite Deployment

This project is a part of [Udacity's Cloud Developer Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/cloud-developer-nanodegree--nd9990).

## Project Overview

The cloud is perfect for hosting static websites that only include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that require no server-side processing. In this project, I've deployed a static website to AWS. I created a S3 bucket, configure the bucket for website hosting, and secure it using IAM policies. I uploaded the website files to your bucket and speed up content delivery using AWSâ€™s content distribution network service, CloudFront. Lastly, I was able to access my website in a browser using the unique S3 endpoint.
